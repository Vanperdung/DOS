# Dead Operating System (DOS)

## Introduction

Welcome to **Dead Operating System (DOS)**! This project is purely for fun and educational purposes, designed to help someone who is interested in low-level developing, learn how operating systems work from the ground up.

## Why "Dead" OS?

The name "Dead OS" is intentional. Unlike commercial operating systems, **DOS** is not meant for real-world use, it has no support, and no practical application beyond learning. It exists purely to educate and entertain those curious about OS development.

## Features

- Real mode and protected mode exploration (DONE)
- Memory management basics (In progress)
- Filesystem experimentation (In progress)
- Multi-tasking implementation (In progress)
- Graphic implementation (Considering)
- Networking implementation (Considering)

## Who Is This For?

This project is perfect for:
- Students and hobbyists interested in OS development
- Developers who want hands-on experience with low-level programming
- Anyone who enjoys tinkering with computer internals

## Disclaimer

Dead OS is **not** designed for production use. It is unstable, incomplete, and full of bugs-on purpose! Use it to learn, break things, and have fun.

## Contributing

Want to contribute? Feel free to experiment, submit pull requests, and explore different implementations. Learning together is what this project is all about!

## License

This project is open-source under the **MIT License**. Use it, modify it, and share it-but donâ€™t expect it to replace your daily OS!

Happy hacking! ðŸ’€
